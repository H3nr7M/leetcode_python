# Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

# Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.

# A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "zzazz"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we do not need any insertions.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "mbadm"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".

# number insertions needed to make a string
# palindrome

# number of insertions

	# Base Cases

		return sys.maxsize
	if (l == h):
		return 0
	if (l == h - 1):
		return 0 if(str[l] == str[h]) else 1

	# Check if the first and last characters are
	# same. On the basis of the comparison result,
	# decide which subproblem(s) to call
	
	if(str[l] == str[h]):
		return findMinInsertions(str, l + 1, h - 1)
	else:
		return (min(findMinInsertions(str, l, h - 1),
					findMinInsertions(str, l + 1, h)) + 1)
