# Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

# For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

def max_profit(prices):
    min_price = float("inf")
    max_profit = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        else:
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
    
    return max_profit

# Example usage:
prices = [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10]
print(max_profit(prices)) # Output: 5
