# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
